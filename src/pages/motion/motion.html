   <p> Wavelength is distance between corresponding points of two consecutive waves.</p> 
   <p>“Corresponding points” refers to two points or particles in the same phase—i.e.,</p> 
   <p>points that have completed identical fractions of their periodic motion.</p> 
   <p>Usually, in transverse waves (waves with points oscillating at right angles to the direction of their advance),</p>
   <p> wavelength is measured from crest to crest or from trough to trough;</p> <p>in longitudinal waves (waves with points vibrating in the same direction as their advance),</p>
   <p> it is measured from compression to compression or from rarefaction to rarefaction.</p> 
   <p>Wavelength is usually denoted by the Greek letter lambda (λ); it is equal to the speed (v) of a wave train in a medium divided by its frequency (f): λ = v/f.</p>

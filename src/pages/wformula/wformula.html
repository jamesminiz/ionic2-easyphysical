Wavelength is the distance between the crests of a wave. Many different things can move like waves, 
like strings, water, the air (sound waves), the ground (earthquakes), and light can be treated as a wave.
 Wavelength is represented with the Greek letter lambda: λ. It is equal to the velocity of the wave, 
 divided by the frequency.
 Wavelength is expressed in units of meters (m)

<p>λ = wavelength, the distance between wave crests (m)</p>
<p>c = wave velocity, the speed that waves are moving in a direction (m/s)</p>
<p>f = frequency, the wave crests that go through a point in a certain time (cycles/s or Hz)</p>
